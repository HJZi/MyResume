#### Motivation

I learned React through Youtube, Velocity-360 and Egghead courses.There are so many talented and dedicated people working on Javascript, I have learned so much from them.

Finally inspired by [Jonathan Bloomer] (http://jonbloomer.com.au/), I started working on Json resume.

* I use Create-react-app create the project
* [Json Resume schema] (https://jsonresume.org/schema/) to create Json resume
* React to build website
* Reference [HTML5up](https://html5up.net/) for style
